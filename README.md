# WIP: BEAT THE BUG
A fun little coding exercise that should become a small and enjoyable little game. See the [wiki](https://github.com/daedal-knickerbockers/code_exercises/wiki) for more details about the project.

## What is the game?
In "Beat the Bug", a group of players try to stand their ground against one giant bug that throws different challenges at them. Every challenge that gets mastered by the players will reduce the bugs strength. However, every player will only be able to loose one challenge and has then to start again from scratch. Those players that beat a challenge will then become stronger, being able to inflict more damage to the bug in the following rounds.

The game itself will be a small web application connected to a backend server and database where player data is handled. Players will be able to see other players and need to work together to beat the bug.

## What is the exercise?
I want to give myself a fun and rewarding challenge in learning and enforcing new technologies, skills and methods I haven't used in a long time or didn't use before at all. Most of all, "Beat the Bug" will be my recurring exercise for the following technologies and clean code techniques.

### Java
The last time I touched Java for something serious has been in university while working part time at my first real developer job. Java 8 was just a new thing out there and nobody really knew how to use all that fancy stuff like lambda expressions or consumers. To this day, I haven't really written anything with Java 8 in mind, let alone Java 12 that has been released earlier that year. I just skimmed through some of the new features. Modules? Optionals? Type Inference? This sure looks really exciting to try out!

### Spring Framework
Most of the time, I don't want to reinvent the wheel and get over with the "boring" stuff that comes with developing and get right into the "fun" stuff. Boring stuff includes writing excessive lines of code or annotation to map application data to a database interface, or writing even more lines of code to just define REST services for your data. It seems that I can now just minimize the time spent on setting up boilerplate and use the Spring framework! Just skimming over the possible features makes me smile 

### Angular
We're up to what version of Angular now? Angular 9? I also missed five version of updates here... My saving grace might be that I already worked intensely with Angular 4, so the new app structure and using Typescript are not unfamiliar to me. The new features also look very cool. Template views generating code? I'll definitely try that! Animation will also play a big part in the game, so good news that *"through Angular's intuitive API"* it should now be very easy to create those.
